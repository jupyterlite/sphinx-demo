# `jupyterlite-sphinx-demo`

This repository showcases JupyterLite deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages as a part of a [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) site using [the `jupyterlite-sphinx` extension](https://jupyterlite-sphinx.rtfd.io) for demo purposes. It is meant to be used as a reference for documentation website authors who want to add interactive documentation elements to their Sphinx sites.

For similar demos that deploy JupyterLite as a standalone site instead, please check out the following:

- https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo for a deployment that uses the Pyodide kernel (`jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel`).
- [the JupyterLite Xeus demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-lite-demo/) for a deployment that uses the Xeus kernel (via `jupyterlite-xeus` and `xeus-python`).

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder structure

This repository is divided into two sections:

- `pyodide-kernel-example/`: this folder contains a JupyterLite deployment with a Sphinx site using the Pyodide kernel, which is a Python kernel that runs in the browser using WebAssembly and uses [the Pyodide distribution](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/).
- `xeus-kernel-example/`: this folder contains a JupyterLite deployment with a Sphinx site using the Xeus kernel, which uses [the emscripten-forge channel](https://emscripten-forge.org/).

Both examples use the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Please check out to the README files under each folder to understand how to use and configure the JupyterLite deployment.

## Further information

For information on how to use and configure JupyterLite and `jupyterlite-sphinx`, please refer to [the JupyterLite documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) and [the `jupyterlite-sphinx` documentation](https://jupyterlite-sphinx.rtfd.io/) respectively.

### Popular websites that use `jupyterlite-sphinx`

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/):
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/) many notebooks under [the `scipy.stats` module](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/tutorial/stats.html) are interactive, and use the Pyodide kernel.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) uses [the Sphinx-Gallery extension](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/) to generate [a gallery of examples](scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/), and uses the extension's [JupyterLite integration](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/configuration.html#jupyterlite) to make them interactive, which relies on `jupyterlite-sphinx` internally. While this is also an option that users may explore, it is not showcased within this demo.
