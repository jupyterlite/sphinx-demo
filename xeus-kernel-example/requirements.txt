# jupyterlite-sphinx brings jupyterlite-core and JupyterLite-specific dependencies.
jupyterlite-sphinx>=0.20.0

# The Xeus kernel is a loader for various JupyterLite-compatible kernels for several
# languages. Kernels and additional dependencies are loaded from an environment.yml
# file, which is included in the docs/ folder. For more information, see the docs at
# https://jupyterlite-xeus.readthedocs.io/en/stable.
# It requires micromamba for solving WASM environments, which has to be installed
# on the system separately of this requirements file. This is not required for
# conda-based development environment setups, as micromamba is a dependency of
# the jupyterlite-xeus conda package and will be installed automatically.
